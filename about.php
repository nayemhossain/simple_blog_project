It was another major achievement when they won a series against India 2-1 in June 2015. They stunned South Africa, defeating them 2-1 in an ODI series in the month of July and cemented their spot in Champions Trophy, 2017. Traditional sports like Athletics, Swimming, Kabaddi, Boli Khela, Lathi Khela are mostly played in the rural areas while foreign sports like cricket, football, hockey, volleyball, handball, golf, badminton etc. are more popular among the urban folks.
